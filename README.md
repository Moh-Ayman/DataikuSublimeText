## Requirements

* Sublime Text 3
* Dataiku DSS 3.1 or further
* Access to Dataiku DSS Public API (with a valid key)

## Configuration and usage

In Sublime Text, once installed with [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/), open the Command Palette (`ctrl+shift+p` on Win/Linux, `cmd+shift+p` on MacOS) and type `dataiku`. You will have two options:

* Edit DSS instances: use this to configure the instances you can edit remotely.
* Browse DSS instances: use this to choose the DSS instance you want to work with, and then the recipe you want to edit.
