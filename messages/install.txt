Thanks for installing Dataiku plugin for Sublime Text!
It allows you to edit Dataiku DSS recipes remotely.

Below are some quick notes to get you started with the plugin. Please see https://github.com/jereze/DataikuSublimeText for more information.

## Requirements:

* Sublime Text 3
* Dataiku DSS 3.1 or further
* Access to Dataiku DSS Public API (with a valid key)

## Configuration:

Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P) and search for "Dataiku: Edit DSS instances".
It opens a configuration files. Complete it with the following model:

{
	"instances": [
		{
			"name": "My DSS Instance",
			"base_url": "http://example.com:1000",
			"api_key": "xxx",
			"list_of_project_keys_to_exclude": [],
			"list_of_plugin_ids_to_exclude": [],
			"keep_only_code_recipes": true
		}
	]
}


## Usage:

Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P) and search for "Dataiku: Browse DSS Instances".
Then, navigate through the recipes, select one.
It opens the recipe in a new tab.
When saving, the recipe is saved on the Dataiku DSS instance via the API.
You should close the tab as soon as you have finished editing, because the merge in case of conflicts is not handled.
